summary: "Traditional antivirus cannot keep up with modern, sophisticated threats; endpoint detection and response (EDR) offers the proactive defence your organisation needs."

For decades, *antivirus* meant a simple program that scanned files against a list of known viruses.  If it found a match, it quarantined the file.  This signature‑based approach worked when malware was relatively simple, but that world is long gone【886322580920872†L7-L8】.  Today’s threats are sophisticated, evasive and often fileless; they use legitimate system tools, operate only in memory and constantly change their code to evade old‑school blacklists【886322580920872†L7-L8】.

### The problem with traditional antivirus

Imagine a security guard at a concert who only has a list of known troublemakers.  They can stop anyone on the list, but they’re powerless against someone who has never caused trouble before【886322580920872†L9-L10】.  This is how traditional AV works—reactive, not proactive.  It’s blind to zero‑day attacks, struggles with fileless malware and provides little information about *how* an attack happened【886322580920872†L9-L11】.

### Enter EDR: the security analyst on your endpoint

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is less like a guard with a list and more like a seasoned detective actively monitoring the entire venue【886322580920872†L12-L14】.  Instead of looking for known bad files, it watches for suspicious behaviour.  It asks questions like:

* “Why is Microsoft Word suddenly trying to launch PowerShell and connect to a strange IP address?”【886322580920872†L14-L15】
* “Why is this user account, which normally only accesses spreadsheets, now trying to scan the entire network?”【886322580920872†L14-L15】
* “Why was a file encrypted just moments after being downloaded from an unusual source?”【886322580920872†L14-L15】

By focusing on the *verb* (the action) rather than just the *noun* (the file), EDR spots malicious activity even if it has never been seen before【886322580920872†L15-L16】.  It provides full visibility into the attack chain, showing exactly what happened so security teams can respond effectively【886322580920872†L15-L16】.

### What this means for your business

Switching from traditional antivirus to EDR is a fundamental shift in security posture.  With EDR you gain【886322580920872†L17-L19】:

* **Proactive threat hunting.** Security teams can actively search for indicators of compromise across the network instead of waiting for an alert【886322580920872†L17-L19】.
* **Real‑time response.** EDR can automatically isolate a compromised computer from the network, stopping an attack like ransomware from spreading【886322580920872†L17-L19】.
* **Deep forensic data.** If a breach occurs, you have a rich, detailed record of the attacker’s every move【886322580920872†L17-L19】.

In today’s threat landscape, simply hoping to block known viruses is a recipe for disaster【886322580920872†L19-L20】.  A robust EDR solution is no longer a luxury for large enterprises—it’s a foundational necessity for any business that takes security seriously.
