Ransomware is one of the most significant and costly threats facing businesses of all sizes.  It encrypts a victim’s files and demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key【686604377036935†L2-L4】.  An attack can halt operations, lead to massive data loss and cause severe reputational damage【686604377036935†L2-L4】.

### The modern ransomware threat

Today’s attackers have evolved beyond simple file encryption.  They often engage in **double extortion**, not only encrypting your data but also exfiltrating it before encryption【686604377036935†L4-L6】.  If you refuse to pay, attackers threaten to leak the stolen data publicly, putting immense pressure on organisations【686604377036935†L4-L6】.

### Key mitigation strategies

Prevention is always better than cure.  A multi‑layered defence strategy is essential【686604377036935†L6-L9】:

* **Employee security training.** Phishing emails remain the most common entry point.  Regular, engaging training helps employees recognise and report suspicious emails【686604377036935†L8-L9】.
* **Robust backup and recovery.** Follow the 3‑2‑1 rule: keep three copies of your data, on two different media types, with one copy off‑site (ideally offline or immutable)【686604377036935†L9-L9】.  Test backups regularly so you can recover quickly when needed.
* **Patch management.** Keep all systems and software patched.  Attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities to gain initial access【686604377036935†L9-L10】.
* **Advanced endpoint protection.** Traditional antivirus is insufficient.  Use an EDR or managed detection and response (MDR) solution that uses behavioural analysis to detect and block ransomware activity in real time【686604377036935†L8-L10】.
* **Principle of least privilege.** Ensure users and administrators only have access to the data and systems they need to perform their jobs.  This limits an attacker’s ability to move laterally across your network if an account is compromised【686604377036935†L9-L10】.
