In the world of IT and cybersecurity, some of the most crucial practices are also the most fundamental.  System patching is a prime example: timely and consistent patch management is one of the most effective defences against cyber‑attacks【551905146770498†L2-L8】.  Unpatched systems are a favourite target for attackers, serving as an open door into your network.

### What is a patch?

A patch is a piece of software code released by a vendor to fix a specific problem or **bug** in a program or operating system【551905146770498†L4-L6】.  Most importantly, patches often fix security vulnerabilities discovered after release.  When a vulnerability is found, attackers can develop *exploits*—code that takes advantage of that vulnerability to gain unauthorized access, deploy malware or steal data【551905146770498†L4-L6】.

Recent studies suggest over 60 % of data breaches in the past two years were caused by unpatched vulnerabilities【551905146770498†L6-L7】.  This statistic highlights a critical gap in many organisations’ security posture.

### Why is patching so important?

Failing to patch your systems is like leaving the front door of your house unlocked.  Here’s why patching is non‑negotiable【551905146770498†L8-L9】:

* **Security.** Patches fix security holes that attackers exploit to deliver ransomware, malware and other threats【551905146770498†L9-L9】.
* **System stability.** Patches often fix bugs that cause crashes or performance degradation【551905146770498†L9-L9】.
* **Compliance.** Many regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, PCI‑DSS, CMMC, etc.) mandate regular patch management; failure to comply can result in fines and legal trouble【551905146770498†L9-L9】.
* **Feature updates.** Some patches introduce new features or enhance existing ones, improving usability and functionality【551905146770498†L9-L9】.
