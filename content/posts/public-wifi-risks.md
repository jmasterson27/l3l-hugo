Connecting to free public Wi‑Fi at coffee shops, airports or hotels is convenient, but it comes with a hidden cost: significant security risks【848934275180630†L7-L8】.  Public networks are open and often unsecured, making it easy for a malicious actor on the same network to intercept your data【848934275180630†L7-L8】.

### Common threats on public Wi‑Fi

Understanding the danger is the first step to protecting yourself.  Unsecured networks enable attacks such as【848934275180630†L9-L11】:

* **Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MitM) attacks.** An attacker positions themselves between you and the connection point, capturing all web traffic—including emails, login details and credit card numbers【848934275180630†L9-L11】.
* **Packet sniffing.** With readily available software, a hacker can “sniff” unencrypted data packets being transmitted across the network.  If you visit a site that doesn’t use HTTPS, everything you send and receive is visible【848934275180630†L11-L12】.
* **“Evil Twin” hotspots.** An attacker sets up a malicious Wi‑Fi hotspot with a convincing name like “Airport Free Wi‑Fi.”  When you connect, they can monitor all your activity or redirect you to phishing pages【848934275180630†L11-L12】.

### How to stay safe: your digital toolkit

You don’t have to give up the convenience of public Wi‑Fi; you just need to be smart about it.  Following these best practices dramatically reduces risk:

1. **Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).** A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, so even if a hacker is sniffing the network, all they see is scrambled data【848934275180630†L14-L15】.
2. **Verify the network name.** Ask an employee for the exact name of the official guest network.  Hackers rely on you connecting to their “Evil Twin” by mistake【848934275180630†L16-L17】.
3. **Stick to HTTPS.** Always look for the padlock icon and “https://” in your browser’s address bar.  While a VPN encrypts everything, HTTPS provides an extra layer of protection on individual sites【848934275180630†L18-L19】.
4. **Turn off sharing and enable your firewall.** Make sure your operating system’s firewall is enabled and disable file/printer sharing for public networks【848934275180630†L20-L21】.

By treating public Wi‑Fi with a healthy dose of scepticism and using these simple tools, you can enjoy connectivity without exposing yourself to unnecessary danger【848934275180630†L22-L22】.
