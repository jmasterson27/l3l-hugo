summary: "The traditional perimeter model no longer works. Zero Trust assumes no user or device should be trusted by default and instead relies on continuous verification to protect modern networks."

The old model of building a high wall around your network and trusting everything inside it no longer works. Remote work, cloud apps and sophisticated attackers have erased the traditional perimeter. **Zero Trust** is a security model built on continuous verification. Every access request is treated as though it originates from an open network and access is granted *just in time* and *just enough* for the task at hand.

### What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a mindset rather than a specific product. It assumes compromise and verifies every request based on user identity, device health, location and other signals. It also limits the blast radius of a breach by granting only the minimal privileges needed to complete a task.

### Core Principles

- **Verify explicitly** — Authenticate and authorize based on all available data, including user identity, device health and location.
- **Use least‑privilege access** — Limit user permissions to only what is necessary.
- **Assume breach** — Design systems with the expectation that an attacker may already be inside.

### Getting Started

Adopting Zero Trust doesn’t require ripping and replacing your entire network. Start by identifying sensitive data and critical applications, segment your network so that compromise of one area doesn’t grant free access to everything, implement multi‑factor authentication and strong logging so you can see who is doing what, and treat Zero Trust as an ongoing journey rather than a one‑time project.
